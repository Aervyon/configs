My configs for tools


## Emacs

You can find my windows config for emacs in [emacs/windows](./emacs/windows)
For Linux it'll be in [emacs/linux](./emacs/windows)
You'll also find all the dependencies necessary for it.

Please do not copy any line before the `;; MELPA` comment, otherwise you may ruin your personal emacs config

Do note, I've switched to [spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org)

## Spacemacs

This can be found in [spacemacs](./spacemacs)
