# Spacemacs Configuration Files

This `.spacemacs` file contains most, if not all of my spacemacs config.

The only thing its missing is the autogenerated config at the bottom - this is done by spacemacs and should not be modified so it is not included here.

Feel free to copy everything here and place it above your spacemacs autogenerated config.
